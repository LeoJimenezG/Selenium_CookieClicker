## üìò How It Works

1. **Window Launch**:  
   - When you run the program, a new browser window will open automatically.  
     ![Window Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbd6bfc9-a3cc-47fe-b774-f7310055a814)  

2. **Cookie Clicking**:  
   - The program will start clicking on the cookie continuously.  

3. **Upgrades**:  
   - Every 10 seconds (by default), the program will check for upgrades or items to purchase. If there are enough cookies, it will buy the available upgrades.  

4. **Duration**:  
   - The automation runs for 5 minutes (by default). After this period, the clicking stops, but the browser window remains open.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization 

### 1. Cooldown Time for Upgrades  
   - Adjust the frequency for checking and buying upgrades by modifying the `buy_time` variable.  
   - Change the value `10` to the desired number of seconds.

### 2. Duration of the Automation
   - Modify the `duration` variable to set how long the automation runs.   
   - Change the value `5` to the desired number of minutes.
