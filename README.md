# Selenium_CookieClicker
Program to automatically play Cookie Clicker using Selenium.
This is the link to the Cookie Clicker game: https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/. It is not the original website, but it is a dedicated website for trying automated processes.

-- How does it work --
- When you run the program a new window will be opened.

- The program will start to click on the cookie.
- After 10 seconds, if there are enough cookies, different upgrades will be bought.
- This process will continue for 5 minutes.
- You can change the cooldown time to update, modifying the variable "buy_time".

- You only need to modify the "10" for the seconds you want.
- You can also change the duration of the process, modifying the variable "duration".

- You only need to modify the "5" for the minutes you want.
- When the process ends, the opened window will remain that way.
